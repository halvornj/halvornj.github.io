#### intro

værbuddy is the result of a 3 month software development project, made by 6 students as a project for a university course.

##### IN2000

[IN2000](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN2000/) is a course at the University of Oslo. This course is mandatory for students studying computer science (such as me!), and makes up 20 study points _(if you don't know what those are - basically, a full time student takes 30 points worth of courses)_.

You can get a full picture of the requirements of the course and project at the university website, but here's my summary:
A team of 6 strangers have to develop an Android-app, using some spesific Api-s from the universitys **institute of meteorology**. There are some given cases, and a couple of restrictions about language, tools and such. here are some of the criteria we had to meet:

- git and github had to be used.
- Agile software development - Scrum, Kanban or a mix
- Using kotlin and Jetpack Compose (others could be used, but the course **strongly** reccomends these)
